\title{Return a single value for a predictor you would like to keep to one specific value.}
\usage{
constant(vec, func = median)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{A vector of numeric, character, or factor.}

\item{func}{A function, which should take a numeric vector and returns a single numeric value.}
}
\value{
A new format-like string, from which the terms you specified have been removed.
}
\description{
For prediction of a regression model, you need to create a data.frame for the combinations of predictor values you would like to get the model's predictions for. Sometimes you would like to keep some of the predictors constant, e.g., their median values. It can be done with this function. This function returns a single value from the vector provided through "vec" with the function provided through "func" (median as default), if the provided vector is numeric. If the vector is character or factor, then the value in the vector with the most occurrences is taken as a representative value and returned.
}
\examples{
# The most frequent occurrence is returned for character/factor.
vec = c(rep('A',2), rep('B',3), rep('C',1))
print(constant(vec))
# The representative value by "func" is returned for numeric (default=median).
set.seed(716)
vec = rnorm(10)
print(constant(vec))
# Another function can be used, too (e.g., max).
print(constant(vec, max))
