\title{Varying values for prediction}
\usage{
vary(vec, len = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{A vector of numeric, character, or factor, based on which values
are produced for prediction.}

\item{len}{A single numeric value, which indicates how many unique values
are required for each of the varied variables.}
}
\value{
A vector of numeric or character (depending on the class of "vec"
provided).
}
\description{
For prediction with a regression model, you need to create a new data.frame
to specify which combinations of predictors you would like to use for
prediction. This function constitutes a part of the process and produces a
sequence of values based on the vector provided through the argument "vec".
If the vector is numeric, a vector of numeric values in the range between
min(vec) and max(vec) with the length of "len" is returned. If the vector is
character or factor, the sorted unique values of the elements in the vector
are returned.
}
\examples{
# The sorted unique values are returned for character/factor.
vec <- c(rep('A',2), rep('B',3), rep('C',1))
print(constant(vec)) # 'A', 'B', 'C'
# A equally-spaced numeric sequence for the length of "len" is
# returned for numeric, with the min and max being the min and
# max of the input vector (i.e., "vec")
set.seed(716)
vec <- rnorm(10)
print(vary(vec))
print(vary(vec, 4))
