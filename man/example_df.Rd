\title{Example data frame (for internal use)}
\usage{
example_df(n = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer for the number of observations (number of rows) for the
output data.frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame with four columns. One of the four columns is named "y"
and intended to be a dependent variable. The other three of the four columns
are "x0", "x1", and "x2", and meant to be predictor variables. These
variables are all continuous variables.
}
\description{
This function returns a dataframe, which contains a variable intended to be
a dependent variable, i.e. "y", and three other variables, which are meant
to be predictors, i.e., "x0", "x1", and "x2". The dependent variable is
designed to have non-linear relationships with the predictors. This function
and the dataframe to be produced are intended for internal use to describe
examples in documentations.
