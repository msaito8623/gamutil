\title{Create a data.frame from a GAM object for prediction}
\usage{
mdl_to_ndat(mdl, target = c(), len = 100, method = median)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{A GAM object (gam or bam), from which you would like to obtain predictions.}

\item{target}{A character vector, which indicates variables to vary.}

\item{len}{A numeric, which specifies length of each varied variable, when the variable is numeric.}

\item{method}{A function that takes a vector of numerics and returns a single value (e.g., median as default). The function given through this argument is used to produce a constant value for each of the numeric variables you would like to keep constant.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the variables specified by "target" being varied and the other variables being kept constant. The returnd data.frame should be ready to be used for, e.g., predict.gam.
}
\description{
In order to obtain predicted values from a GAM object, you need to provide a data.frame with combinations of values for the predictors in the model to mgcv::predict.gam. This function does this job only by giving it a GAM object (i.e., mdl) and telling it which variables you would like to vary (i.e, target).
}
\examples{
library(mgcv)
set.seed(534)
dat = gamSim(verbose=FALSE)
model = gam(y ~ s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2), data=dat)
target_to_vary = c('x0','x1')
ndat = mdl_to_ndat(mdl=model, target=target_to_vary, len=4, method=median)
print(length(unique(ndat$y))==1) # y is fixed constant.
print(length(unique(ndat$x0))==4) # x0 is varied with length=4.
print(length(unique(ndat$x1))==4) # x1 is varied with length=4.
print(length(unique(ndat$x2))==1) # x2 is fixed constant.
