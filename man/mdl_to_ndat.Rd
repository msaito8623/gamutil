\title{Create a data.frame from a GAM object for prediction}
\usage{
mdl_to_ndat(mdl, target = c(), cond = list(), len = 100, method = median)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{A GAM object (gam or bam), from which you would like to obtain
predictions.}

\item{target}{A character vector, which indicates variables to vary.}

\item{cond}{A list of variables (as names) and their values. "cond"
overrides "target".}

\item{len}{A numeric, which specifies length of each varied variable, when
the variable is numeric.}

\item{method}{A function that takes a vector of numerics and returns a
single value (e.g., median as default). The function given through this
argument is used to produce a constant value for each of the numeric
variables you would like to keep constant.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with the variables specified by "target" being varied
and the other variables being kept constant. The returned data.frame should
be ready to be used for, e.g., predict.gam.
}
\description{
In order to obtain predicted values from a GAM object, you need to provide a
data.frame with combinations of values for the predictors in the model to
mgcv::predict.gam. This function does this job only by giving it a GAM
object (i.e., mdl) and telling it which variables you would like to vary
(i.e, target).
}
\examples{
library(mgcv)
set.seed(534)
dat <- gamSim(verbose=FALSE)
model <- gam(y ~ s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2) + s(x3), data=dat)
target_to_vary <- c('x0','x1')
condlist <- list('x2'=quantile(dat$x2, probs=c(0.25,0.75)))
ndat <- mdl_to_ndat(mdl=model, target=target_to_vary,
                    cond=condlist, len=4, method=median)
print(length(unique(ndat$x0))==4) # x0 is varied with length=4.
print(length(unique(ndat$x1))==4) # x1 is varied with length=4.
print(length(unique(ndat$x2))==2) # x2 is 25\% or 75\% quantiles.
print(length(unique(ndat$x3))==1) # x3 is fixed the median.
