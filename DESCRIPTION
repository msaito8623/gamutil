Description: After fitting a Generalized Additive (Mixed) Model, the next step is often to obtain predicted values for certain combinations of predictors for visualization of estimated effects in the model. It involves constructing a new data frame, add predicted values, and finally makes a (contour) plot. This package is intended to facilitate these steps to visualize estimated effects in a GAM.
