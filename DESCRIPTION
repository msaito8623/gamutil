Description: Fitting a Generalized Additive (Mixed) Model, the next step may be to obtain predicted values for certain combinations of predictors for visualization. It involves constructing a new data.frame, add predicted values, and finally makes a plot. Each of the steps, especially visualization of predicted values with a contour plot, takes lines of coding and time, too. This package is intended to facilitate this process.
